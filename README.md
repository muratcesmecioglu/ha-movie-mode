# ðŸŽ¥ Movie Mode Light Control
## Turn Off Lights Automatically During Movies!

**Movie Mode Light Control**, designed to help automate your movie nights by dimming the environment when your movie starts â€” and bringing everything back to life when you pause or stop.

### ðŸŽ¥ What It Does

This blueprint detects when your media player (e.g., TV or streaming device) starts playing and:

* **Sends a notification** asking if you want to activate Movie Mode.
* **Turns off selected lights or switches** automatically when Movie Mode is enabled.
* **Restores your previous light/switch states** when the movie is paused or stopped.
* **Automatically disables Movie Mode** when the media ends or stops.
* **Only activates after a specific time** (e.g., after 9:00 PM) to avoid triggering during the day.

### ðŸ§  How It Works

It uses a combination of:

* `media_player` state triggers (Playing, Paused, Idle, etc.)
* An `input_boolean` helper to track Movie Mode status.
* Optional `notify` service to ask for user confirmation (e.g., via mobile app).
* Customizable activation time.

You can also customize:

* Notification target (e.g., `mobile_app_yourphone`)
* Notification title & message
* Trigger states for play, pause, and off
* Lights/switches to be controlled
